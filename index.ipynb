"\n",
"FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq is a collection of asynchronous programming utilities for F#.\n",
"\n",
"An AsyncSeq is a sequence in which individual elements are retrieved using an `Async` computation.\n",
"The power of `AsyncSeq` lies in that many of these operations also have analogs based on `Async` \n",
"allowing composition of complex asynchronous workflows, including compositional cancellation.\n",
"\n",
"An `AsyncSeq\u003c\u0027a\u003e` can be generated using computation expression syntax much like `seq\u003c\u0027a\u003e`:\n",

"      yield 1\n",
"      do! Async.Sleep 1000 // non-blocking sleep\n",
