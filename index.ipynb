"\n",
"FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq is a collection of asynchronous programming utilities for F#.\n",
"\n",
"An `AsyncSeq\u003c\u0027T\u003e` is a sequence in which individual elements are retrieved using an `Async` computation.\n",
"The power of `AsyncSeq` lies in that many of these operations also have analogs based on `Async` \n",
"allowing composition of complex asynchronous workflows, including compositional cancellation.\n",
"\n",
"\u003e **v4.0:** `AsyncSeq\u003c\u0027T\u003e` is now a type alias for `System.Collections.Generic.IAsyncEnumerable\u003c\u0027T\u003e`.\n",
"\u003e Values flow freely between `AsyncSeq\u003c\u0027T\u003e` and `IAsyncEnumerable\u003c\u0027T\u003e` without any conversion.\n",
"\u003e `AsyncSeq.ofAsyncEnum` / `AsyncSeq.toAsyncEnum` are now no-ops and marked obsolete — remove them.\n",
"\u003e See the [README](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq#version-40--bcl-iasyncenumerable-compatibility) for migration notes.\n",
"\n",
"An `AsyncSeq\u003c\u0027a\u003e` can be generated using computation expression syntax much like `seq\u003c\u0027a\u003e`:\n",
