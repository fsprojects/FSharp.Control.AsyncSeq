FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq
=============

FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq is a collection of asynchronous programming utilities for F#.

An AsyncSeq is a sequence in which individual elements are retrieved using an `Async` computation.
The power of `AsyncSeq` lies in that many of these operations also have analogs based on `Async` 
allowing composition of complex asynchronous workflows, including compositional cancellation.

An `AsyncSeq<'a>` can be generated using computation expression syntax much like `seq<'a>`:

    let oneThenTwo = asyncSeq {
      yield 1
      do! Async.Sleep 1000 // non-blocking sleep
      yield 2
    }

Learning
--------------------------

[AsyncSeq](AsyncSeq.html) contains narrative and code samples explaining asynchronous sequences.

[AsyncSeq Examples](AsyncSeqExamples.html) contains examples.

[Terminology](terminology.html) a reference for some of the terminology around F# async.
 
[Comparison with IObservable](ComparisonWithIObservable.html) contains discussion about the difference between async sequences and IObservables.

[API Reference](reference/index.html) contains automatically generated documentation for all types, modules and functions in the library. 
This includes additional brief samples on using most of the functions.
