"# Comparison with IObservable\n",
"\n",
"Both `IObservable\u003c\u0027T\u003e` and `AsyncSeq\u003c\u0027T\u003e` represent collections of items and both provide similar operations\n",
"for transformation and composition. The central difference between the two is that the former uses a *synchronous push*\n",
"to a subscriber and the latter uses an *asynchronous pull* by a consumer. \n",
"Consumers of an `IObservable\u003c\u0027T\u003e` *subscribe* to receive notifications about\n",
"new items or the end of the sequence. By contrast, consumers of an `AsyncSeq\u003c\u0027T\u003e` *asynchronously retrieve* subsequent items on their own\n",
"terms. Some domains are more naturally modeled with one or the other, however it is less clear which is a more\n",
"suitable tool for a specific task. In many cases, a combination of the two provides the optimal solution and \n",
"restricting yourself to one, while simplifying the programming model, can lead one to view all problems as a nail.\n",
"\n",
"A more specific difference between the two is that `IObservable\u003c\u0027T\u003e` subscribers have the basic type `\u0027T -\u003e unit` \n",
"and are therefore inherently synchronous and imperative. The observer can certainly make a blocking call, but this \n",
"can defeat the purpose of the observable sequence all together. Alternatively, the observer can spawn an operation, but\n",
"this can break composition because one can no longer rely on the observer returning to determine that it has \n",
"completed. With the observable model however, we can model blocking operations through composition on sequences rather\n",
"than observers.\n",
"\n",
"To illustrate, let\u0027s try to implement the above Tweet retrieval, filtering and storage workflow using observable sequences.\n",
"Suppose we already have an observable sequence representing tweets `IObservable\u003cTweet\u003e` and we simply wish \n",
"to filter it and store the resulting tweets. The function `Observable.filter` allows one to filter observable\n",
"sequences based on a predicate, however in this case it doesn\u0027t quite cut it because the predicate passed to it must\n",
"be synchronous `\u0027T -\u003e bool`:\n",
